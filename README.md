## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** (v18 or later)
* **npm** (Node Package Manager)
* **MongoDB Atlas Account:** You'll need a [free MongoDB Atlas account](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and your connection string.

### Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/mern-job-tracker.git](https://github.com/your-username/mern-job-tracker.git)
    cd mern-job-tracker
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the backend folder:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

3.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Create your environment file:**
    * Create a new file named `.env` in the `backend` folder.
    * Add your MongoDB connection string to it:
    ```env
    MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<your_username>:<your_password>@your-cluster-url.mongodb.net/job-tracker
    ```

5.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Your backend will be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Open a new terminal.**

2.  **Navigate to the frontend folder:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

3.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Your frontend will open at `http://localhost:5173` (or a similar port). The app is configured with a proxy, so it can communicate with your backend.

## API Endpoints

The backend server provides the following RESTful API endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GET` | `/api/jobs` | Get all job applications. |
| `POST` | `/api/jobs` | Create a new job application. |
| `GET` | `/api/jobs/:id` | Get a single job by its ID. |
| `PUT` | `/api/jobs/:id` | Update a job by its ID. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/jobs/:id` | Delete a job by its ID. |
